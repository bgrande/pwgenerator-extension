vault-pwgenerator-extension
===========================

Generates safe passwords within browser context based on jcoglan's vault (https://github.com/jcoglan/vault)

Right now chrome only


Issues
=======
* options are not retrieved completely
* standard options are incomplete
* check the overlay id naming -> might cause conflicts if there is no password input field id

Todo
======
* use option servicename
* find a better way to get the service/loginname
